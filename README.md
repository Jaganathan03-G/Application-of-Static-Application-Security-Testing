TCS iON RIO-125: Application of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools â€“ Find Defects in Insecure Web-based Applications 




The application of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in finding defects in insecure web-based applications involves using specialized software to analyze the source code of the application. These tools identify security vulnerabilities, coding errors, and potential weaknesses early in the development process. By scanning the code, SAST tools help developers identify and fix issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure authentication mechanisms, and other vulnerabilities that could lead to security breaches. This approach enhances the overall security and quality of web applications by proactively addressing potential defects before deployment.
